Link to app: https://jamesboblak.github.io/weather-dashboard/  
This weather dashboard features a color-changing warning that alerts poor UV Index, today's temperature, weather conditions, relative humidty, and average windspeed, plus a five-day forecast showing weather icons, the temperature, and relative humidity.
![Demo gif](./images/weather-dashboard_demo.gif) 
Simply "Enter a city name" and then click on the Get today's weather button.  This will show today's weather conditions in the city entered, and then will alert the UV Index for today in that city.  If the UVI is healthy, the background for today's card will turn green.  If uVI is moderate, the card will show an orange background, with a red background showing unhealthy UVI conditions in that city today.  Entering a second city adds its data to the cards below the data from the first city for easy comparison.
